# ModerateAI - Machine Learning Model Documentation

## Overview
The ModerateAI system implements a sophisticated ensemble approach for Sinhala/Singlish hate speech detection, combining three complementary machine learning techniques:

## 1. Transformer-based Analysis (mBERT Simulation)
**Purpose**: Context-aware analysis using attention mechanisms
**Implementation**: 
- Tokenizes Sinhala/Singlish text with Unicode support
- Generates embeddings for each token
- Uses attention-like context windows to understand word relationships
- Applies context multipliers for surrounding negative words

**Key Features**:
- **Sinhala Script Support**: Handles Unicode characters (මූ, ගොන්, හුත්ත)
- **Context Awareness**: Considers surrounding words to avoid false positives
- **Attention Mechanism**: Simulates transformer attention for better accuracy

## 2. LSTM Sequential Analysis
**Purpose**: Captures sequential patterns and emotional intensity
**Implementation**:
- Processes text sequentially like human reading
- Maintains hidden state between words
- Analyzes bigram patterns (word combinations)
- Tracks emotional escalation through text

**Key Features**:
- **Sequential Memory**: Remembers previous context while processing
- **Bigram Detection**: Identifies hate speech phrases like "මූ බල්ලා", "hate you"
- **Emotional Tracking**: Measures intensity buildup in hostile messages

## 3. FastText Subword Analysis
**Purpose**: Detects encoded and obfuscated hate speech
**Implementation**:
- Analyzes character n-grams (2-4 characters)
- Detects L33t speak (h8, k1ll, st@pid)
- Identifies symbol substitution and character repetition
- Handles deliberate misspellings and evasion techniques

**Key Features**:
- **Encoded Detection**: Catches "st@pid", "h8", "muu" variations
- **Obfuscation Handling**: Detects repeated characters (stuuupid)
- **Symbol Analysis**: Recognizes special character substitutions

## Model Ensemble Architecture

### Weighted Combination:
```
Final Hate Score = (
  Transformer Score × 0.4 +
  LSTM Sequence Score × 0.3 +
  FastText Subword Score × 0.2 +
  Encoding Detection × 0.1
)
```

### Confidence Calculation:
- Based on agreement between different models
- Higher confidence when all models agree
- Lower confidence for ambiguous cases

## Language-Specific Features

### Sinhala Hate Speech Patterns:
```javascript
Direct Terms: 'මූ': 0.9, 'ගොන්': 0.85, 'හුත්ත': 0.95
Harassment: 'මරනවා': 0.9, 'ගහනවා': 0.8, 'කපනවා': 0.85
Positive Context: 'හොඳ': 0.8, 'ලස්සන': 0.7, 'ආදරය': 0.9
```

### Singlish/English Integration:
```javascript
Mixed Language: 'stupid fool': 0.8, 'hate you': 0.85
Emotional Indicators: 'really': 0.2, 'wtf': 0.6, 'omg': 0.4
Context Phrases: 'get out': 0.6, 'shut up': 0.7
```

## Advanced Detection Features

### 1. Context-Aware Scoring
- Words gain higher scores when surrounded by negative context
- Positive words reduce overall hate scores
- Considers cultural context in Sinhala expressions

### 2. Encoded Variation Detection
- **L33t Speak**: h8 → hate, k1ll → kill, st@pid → stupid
- **Character Repetition**: stuuupid, haaaate
- **Symbol Substitution**: !@#$%^&* patterns
- **Obfuscated Sinhala**: muu → මූ, pak@ → පකා

### 3. Emotional Intensity Analysis
- Tracks emotional buildup through message sequence
- Identifies escalation patterns in conversations
- Measures intensity using punctuation and emphasis

## Real-Time Processing Pipeline

### Step 1: Text Preprocessing
```
Input: "මූ stupid බල්ලා h8 you"
↓
Tokenization: ["මූ", "stupid", "බල්ලා", "h8", "you"]
↓
Unicode Normalization: Handles Sinhala script properly
```

### Step 2: Multi-Model Analysis
```
Transformer: Analyzes context and attention
LSTM: Processes sequence and emotional flow  
FastText: Examines subwords and encoding
```

### Step 3: Ensemble Decision
```
Hate Score: 0.87 (87% confidence)
Harassment Score: 0.65 (65% confidence)
Normal Score: 0.13 (13% confidence)
Final Classification: "hate_speech"
```
